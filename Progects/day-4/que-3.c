// Write a C program that uses the assignment operators to increment a variable by 5 and then decrement it by 2. Print the final value of the variable. If value was 10 adding 5 = 15, then subtracting 2 =13
// Output:
// Final Value: 13

main(){
    int a=10;
    int b=5;
    int c=2;
    int d=10+5-2;
    printf("%d",d);
